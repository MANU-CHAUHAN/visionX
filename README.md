### How to interpret the repository:

1) `Models` dir has all CV models, custom models are under `custom.py`.

2) `Utils` dir contains utility functions and components.

3) Extra resources like images or gifs would go under `resources` .

4) `Notebooks` dir will hold all Jupyter Notebooks for experiments and/or well as final runs for presenting results.
